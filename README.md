# tesla-stock-price-prediction-using-gru-tutorial
"Utilizing ML and GRU techniques, our project explores Tesla stock price prediction. Methodology involves EDA, Sequential Model Building, GRU models, and model evaluation techniques for accuracy."

•	The first step involves preparing the data, which includes cleaning and formatting it. An exploratory analysis then comes in to discover trends and significant insights. 


•	Through a targeted analysis of past trends of the stock price, the data for predictive modelling is well-informed. 


•	The model is therefore constructed in the form of a GRU neural network, a type of recurrent neural network which is appropriate for time-series data. 


•	The predictive accuracy of the model is proved by comparing it with actual closing prices, and performance estimation is thoroughly conducted through statistical metrics. 


•	Finally, the model predicts the price of the stock for the upcoming thirty days and is able to produce graphics illustrating expected trends in the context of historical data.
